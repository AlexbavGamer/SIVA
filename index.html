        <h2>What is the SIVA rewrite?</h2>
            <code>The SIVA rewrite is a simple term for creating the bot in an entirely new programming language. Discord.py was getting rewritten, and it was becoming obsolete, so I decided to completely remake the entire bot. It's taken 40+ hours, but it's nearly done.</code>
