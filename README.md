## What is the SIVA rewrite?
`The SIVA rewrite is a simple term for creating the bot in an entirely new programming language. Discord.py was getting rewritten, and it was becoming obsolete, so I decided to completely remake the entire bot. It's taken 40+ hours, but it's nearly done.`

## Found an issue with the Public SIVA?
`Create an issue.`

## Want to invite the bots?

### Invite SIVA
> https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&scope=bot&permissions=8
  
**By default, this has the Administrator permission checked. Keep this if you're using the support system. If you're not, feel free to uncheck. It's still advised to keep it checked. If you don't want admin, here's another invite link.**
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&permissions=201682038&scope=bot
If you want support and refuse to give the bot the admin permission if it needs it, you won't get support. Period.

### What is SIVA-dev (bot)
It's the debugging copy of SIVA. It's only online when I am debugging new changes. Recommended to not use it, the invite here is mostly for my purposes. If you see this in SIVA-dev, donotfear.

### Permission rundown

For the secondary bot invite: `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&permissions=201682038&scope=bot` there's a few permissions checked. Here's a rundown of what they all do.

Manage {blank}: admin module.

Kick/Ban members: what else do you think this is for?

Use external emojis: for a WHO PENG emoji on the ping command and future commands

Embed Links: REQUIRED. all commands are embeds and therefore require this.

Send/Read Messages: obvious.
