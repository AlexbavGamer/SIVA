## What is the SIVA rewrite?
`The SIVA rewrite is a simple term for creating the bot in an entirely new programming language. Discord.py was getting rewritten, and it was becoming obsolete, so I decided to completely remake the entire bot. It's taken 40+ hours, but it's nearly done.`

## Found an issue with the Public SIVA?
`Create an issue.`

## Want to invite the bots?

### Invite SIVA
> [SIVA-dev](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=410547925597421571&permissions=8)

> [SIVA-public](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&scope=bot&permissions=8) 
  
**By default, this has the Administrator permission checked. Keep this if you're using the support system. If you're not, feel free to uncheck. It's still advised to keep it checked.**

### What is SIVA-dev (bot)
It's the debugging copy of SIVA. It's only online when I am debugging new changes. Recommended to not use it, the invite here is mostly for my purposes.
